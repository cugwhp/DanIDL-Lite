The modules in this directory deal with the subject of general vector processing. In DanIDL, the term
"vector" is used to refer to any one-dimensional array, and the elements of this array are generally
referred to as pixels. Some modules further require a minimum length for the input vector(s).

In DanIDL, I adopt three different definitions for vector coordinate systems:

(i) The pixel index coordinate system for vectors is a discrete coordinate system that defines the
    left-hand pixel in a vector to be at the integer x coordinate of 0. For each pixel moved to the
    right in the vector, the x pixel index increments by 1. This pixel coordinate system is defined
    in this manner in order to be consistent with IDL array indices which start at zero.

(ii) The pixel number coordinate system for vectors is also a discrete coordinate system with the
     same properties as the pixel index coordinate system, except that it defines the left-hand pixel
     in a vector to be at the integer x coordinate of 1.

(iii) The continuous pixel coordinate system for vectors is defined such that the origin of the
      coordinate system is at the left-hand side of the left-hand pixel in a vector. Therefore, the
      centre of the left-hand pixel in a vector has an x coordinate of 0.5 in this coordinate system.
      For each full pixel moved to the right in the vector, the x pixel coordinate increments by 1.

These definitions apply to all DanIDL modules, not just those that are present in this directory.
