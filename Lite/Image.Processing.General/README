The modules in this directory deal with the subject of general image processing. In DanIDL, the term
"image" is used to refer to any two-dimensional array, and the elements of this array are generally
referred to as pixels. Some modules further require a minimum size along each image dimension for the
input image(s).

In DanIDL, I adopt three different definitions for image coordinate systems:

(i) The pixel index coordinate system for images is a discrete coordinate system that defines the
    bottom left-hand pixel in an image to be at the integer coordinates (0,0). For each pixel moved
    to the right in the image, the x pixel index increments by 1, and similarly for each pixel moved
    up in the image, the y pixel index increments by 1. This pixel coordinate system is defined in
    this manner in order to be consistent with IDL array indices which start at zero.

(ii) The pixel number coordinate system for images is also a discrete coordinate system with the same
     properties as the pixel index coordinate system, except that it defines the bottom left-hand
     pixel in an image to be at the integer coordinates (1,1).

(iii) The continuous pixel coordinate system for images is defined such that the origin of the
      coordinate system is at the bottom left-hand corner of the bottom left-hand pixel in an image.
      Therefore, the centre of the bottom left-hand pixel in an image has coordinates (0.5,0.5) in
      this coordinate system. For each full pixel moved to the right in the image, the x pixel
      coordinate increments by 1, and similarly for each full pixel moved up in the image, the y pixel
      coordinate increments by 1.

These definitions apply to all DanIDL modules, not just those that are present in this directory.
