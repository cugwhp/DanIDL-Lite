The modules in this directory deal with the subject of variance (and covariance) propagation for random
variables. In order to help the programmer with the selection of the correct module for any particular
variance propagation problem, I have listed the available modules along with the situations for which
they are designed and the conditions under which their calculations are valid.

The modules are designed to deal with the following general classes of problems:

(i) A transformation of a single random variable applied to each of M random variables.
(ii) M sets of transformations of a single random variable applied to each of M random variables.
(iii) A transformation of two random variables applied to each of M pairs of random variables.
(iv) M sets of transformations of two random variables applied to M pairs of random variables.
(v) A transformation of N random variables applied to one set of N random variables.
(vi) A transformation of N random variables applied to each of M sets of N random variables.
(vii) M sets of transformations of N random variables applied to one set of N random variables.
(viii) M sets of transformations of N random variables applied to M sets of N random variables.

The programmer should check the conditions under which the variance propagation calculations performed
by a module are valid:

(i) In the best case, the variance propagation calculations performed by a module are valid regardless
    of the underlying probability density functions (PDFs) of the random variables that are being
    transformed. However, some calculations may only be valid for certain PDFs. Alternatively, some
    modules provide options for simpler and/or speedier calculations when the underlying PDF is known.

(ii) The most general modules deal with transformations of multiple random variables with non-zero
     covariances. However, some modules perform variance propagation calculations that are only valid
     for random variables with zero covariances (which includes the case of independent random
     variables). Alternatively, some modules provide options for simpler and/or speedier calculations
     when the random variables are known to have zero covariances (or are known to be independent).
     Note that if two random variables are independent, then their covariance is zero, but that the
     converse of this statement is not true.

The programmer should also be aware of the following:

(i) Some modules perform variance propagation calculations that employ exact analytical expressions,
    and so the results supplied by these modules may be considered to be exact. However, some modules
    only employ approximation formulae since exact analytical expressions either do not exist or are
    highly complicated.

(ii) Some modules also perform propagation of the expected values (or means) of the random variables.
     However, for a linear transformation/combination of random variables, the expected values undergo
     the same transformation, and hence I have not implemented expected value propagation in the
     relevant modules. Similarly, for variance propagation using approximation formulae derived via
     linearisation by first-order Taylor series expansion, the expected values undergo the same
     transformation to first order as that applied to the random variables (only second-order correction
     terms may be non-zero). Therefore again I have not implemented expected value propagation in the
     corresponding modules.

(iii) Modules that employ approximation formulae for variance propagation, as derived by linearisation
      by first-order Taylor series expansion, may be used in serial to obtain the same approximation
      result as if the linearisation method were applied directly to the full compound transformation
      of the random variable(s) (including when the covariances of the random variables are non-zero).

      For example:
      Consider the transformation:
        X = 1/A^2
      Then, to first order we have:
        Var(X) = 4*Var(A)/(E(A)^6)
      However, we may also write the transformation as:
        Y = A^2
        X = 1/Y
      Then, to first order we have:
        Var(Y) = 4*(E(A)^2)*Var(A)
        Var(X) = Var(Y)/(E(Y)^4)
      Which reduces to:
        Var(X) = 4*Var(A)/(E(A)^6)
      Therefore, we may use the following two variance propagation modules, in either order, to
      propagate the variance to first order for the transformation X = 1/A^2:
        propagate_variance_for_square_of_rv.pro
        propagate_variance_for_inverse_of_rv.pro

      Clearly, variance propagation modules that employ exact formulae may also be used in serial in
      the same way to obtain an exact variance propagation result for a compound transformation of
      random variable(s).

      However, using an approximate variance propagation module in serial with an exact variance
      propagation module will neither yield an exact result, nor a first order approximation result,
      for the variance propagation of the compound transformation (unless the exact variance
      propagation module deals specifically with a linear transformation of the random variable(s)).
      Instead, the compounded variance propagation result will be approximate to an ill-defined order
      somewhat better than first order. Furthermore, the result may depend on the order in which the
      modules are employed. Hence care should be taken with interpreting the results when the variance
      propagation modules are used in this fashion.
